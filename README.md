# Guide to coordinated vulnerability disclosure for open source software projects


This repository is a set of resources and reference materials to help open source projects to coordinated vulnerability disclosure.


## This repository contains:

* **[Guide to coordinated vulnerability disclosure for open source software projects](https://github.com/ossf/oss-vulnerability-guide/blob/main/guide.md):** This contains background material on vulnerability disclosure, the steps to the CVD process, considerations for the decision points of the process, and "troubleshooting" for common scenarios.
* **[Templates](https://github.com/ossf/oss-vulnerability-guide/tree/main/templates):** These will help you get started with the communication components of CVD. This includes [`SECURITY.md` templates](https://github.com/ossf/oss-vulnerability-guide/tree/main/templates/security_policies), [embargoed notification](https://github.com/ossf/oss-vulnerability-guide/blob/main/templates/notifications/embargo.md) and [vulnerability disclosure](https://github.com/ossf/oss-vulnerability-guide/blob/main/templates/notifications/disclosure.md).
* **[Runbook](https://github.com/ossf/oss-vulnerability-guide/blob/main/runbook.md):** A step-by-step for the CVD process. For additional information on these steps, refer to the [Guide](https://github.com/ossf/oss-vulnerability-guide/blob/main/guide.md).

## Getting Started

If you are new to coordinated vulnerability disclosure, it is recommended you start with the [Guide](https://github.com/ossf/oss-vulnerability-guide/blob/main/guide.md). While it is dense, you will want to be familiar with this information and the concepts presented *before* you need to address a vulnerability report. 

If you are familiar with coordinated vulnerability disclosure, you can get a refresher by skipping to the [Response Process](https://github.com/ossf/oss-vulnerability-guide/blob/main/guide.md#response-process) section of the Guide, or go straight to the [Runbook](https://github.com/ossf/oss-vulnerability-guide/blob/main/runbook.md).
